This project implements a kd-tree, as taught in my introduction to algorithms and
data structures course (CS 240) at the University of Waterloo. Hence, this implementation
disallows sets of points in which there is a repeated x or y coordinate.

As per CS 240 tradition, the implementation is written in C++, the language of choice
for serious programmers. ðŸ™‚
